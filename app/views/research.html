          Using novel survey questions on the higher-order expectations of firm managers, we study the formation and
          evolution of these beliefs. A unique experimental approach allows us to characterize the degree of
          higher-order thinking of economic agents and how this degree of higher-order thinking affects managers’
          expectations as well as their economic decisions. We then relate these results to macroeconomic models in
          which higher-order thinking matters for dynamics.

          This paper shows that consumers with longer-tailed subjective probability distributions of inflation
          anticipate tighter access to future credit and lower real consumption growth. I propose a model in which rare
          inflation disasters decrease in credit access by raising debt issuance costs. I then empirically examine the
          predictions of the model on readiness to buy durables and reported future MPC, showing that consumers with
          long-tailed distributions are more likely to purchase durables and more likely to spend out of an unexpected
          increase in future income.

          This paper contributes to and extends our current understanding of information frictions in expectations. I
          first propose a new framework for estimating noisy information using individual forecasts, rather than mean
          forecasts as commonly done in previous work. This approach provides more power for identifying underlying
          information rigidities. I further extend this framework to incorporate misperceptions on the part of economic
          agents about the persistence of the underlying process being forecasted. Applying this framework to the U.S.
          inflation forecasts of professional forecasters points toward significantly less noisy information than
          previous estimates suggest but reveals a systematic underestimation on the part of forecasters of the
          persistence of inflation. Using a structural model that incorporates both noisy signals and misperceptions of
          persistence, I quantify the relative importance of each channel in accounting for the expectations formation
          process of these agents. The results indicate that, even for professional forecasters, there are multiple
          forces that generate economically significant deviations from full information.

        <h4>Balance of Risks and the Anchoring of Consumer Expectations</h4>

          This paper shows that expected inflation risks pose threats to the anchoring of expectations. I propose a new
          method for fitting subjective probability distributions to density forecasts that allows for asymmetric
          beliefs over inflation outcomes. Using data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer
          Expectations, I show that medium-run expectations move in the direction of perceived short-run risks. I
          introduce a diffusion index of consumers’ perceived balance of risks to inflation and show that movements in
          the short-run index predict movements in the medium-run expectations and in the medium-run index. I conclude
          with a new measure of aggregate expectations for consumers that incorporates asymmetry in individual
          subjective probability distributions.

        <h4>Job Search, Wages, and Inflation</h4>

          How do inflation expectations and inflation affect the job search behavior of workers, given that wages are
          typically set in nominal terms? Using pre-COVID data from the Survey of Consumer Expectations, we show that
          employed workers who expect higher inflation are more likely to search for jobs and are subsequently more
          likely to have a job-to-job transition over the short term. This behavior is consistent with the idea that
          people look for new jobs with higher real earnings, anticipating that real earnings at their current job will
          fall with inflation. We validate this hypothesis using new survey data collected via the Real Time Population
          Survey that asks individuals how their (i) current nominal earnings and (ii) search behavior would respond
          under various inflation scenarios. We then develop a model which can replicate these patterns, and use the
          model to study the partial equilibrium passthrough of shocks to inflation and inflation expectations to wages.
          We demonstrate that even short run increases in inflation expectations can affect job-to-job transitions via
          search on-the-job, and that the effects are larger at the lower end of the wage distribution. Together, the
          findings suggest that inflation dynamics may have played a role in generating the observed post-Covid wage
          compression.

          We use high frequency identification methods to study the response of consumer inflation expectations to many
          different types of events. We use data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer
          Expectations. We identify the response of expectations to a large set of shocks, including FOMC announcements,
          macroeconomic data releases, and news related to the Covid-19 pandemic. The majority of FOMC meetings have no
          detectable effects on consumer inflation expectations, though certain especially salient announcements have
          short-lived effects. Good news about the pandemic tends to reduce inflation expectations.

          How does inflation transmit to changes in nominal wages? We proposal a model of on- the-job search in which
          wages are negotiated in nominal terms and fixed for the duration of the match or until one party has a
          credible threat to renegotiate. In the model with an exogenous search decision, inflationary shocks accelerate
          the rate of on-the-job wage negotiations. When search is allowed to increase endogenously in response to
          inflation, the rate of job-to-job transitions and counteroffers accelerate simultaneously. This implies that
          inflationary shocks generate both productive and inflationary wage changes.

        <h4>Disagreement among Professional Forecasters about FOMC Forward Guidance</h4>

          We document that the quantity of FOMC forward guidance increases disagreement among professional forecasters’
          about GDP growth and inflation over the next twelve months. The same forward guidance events reduce
          disagreement about future interest rates and leave measures of individual forecasters’ uncertainty unchanged.
          We show that both persistent heterogeneity across forecasters’ models and transitory differences in their
          interpretations of particular FOMC statements contribute FOMC-induced disagreement.

          This paper estimates time-varying information flows/attention to unemployment using cross- sectional
          variability in the SPF. We use this series of attention along with a standard set of macro time series and
          three measures of macroeconomic volatility computed by Jurado et al. (2015) to estimate a BVAR. We use this
          model to identify autonomous movements in attention and study their macroeconomic consequences. We find that
          these consequences are important and explain a large chunk of macro volatility at business-cycle frequencies.
          An exogenous increase in attention to unemployment triggers a persistent economic boom. Shocks to the private
          sector’s attention lower macro volatility and, in fact, explain most of the fluctuations in uncertainty at
          longer horizons. Consistent with rational inattention theory, the private sector’s attention rises following
          an exogenous increase in macroeconomic volatility.
