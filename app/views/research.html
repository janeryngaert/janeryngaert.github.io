                       This paper contributes to and extends our current understanding of information 
                       frictions in expectations. I first propose a new framework for estimating noisy 
                       information using individual forecasts, rather than mean forecasts as commonly 
                       done in previous work.  This approach provides more power for identifying 
                       underlying information rigidities. I further extend this framework to incorporate 
                       misperceptions on the part of economic agents about the persistence of the
                        underlying process being forecasted. Applying this framework to the U.S.
                        inflation forecasts of professional forecasters points toward significantly 
                        less noisy information than previous estimates suggest but reveals a 
                        systematic underestimation on the part of forecasters of the persistence of inflation.
                         Using a structural model that incorporates both noisy signals and misperceptions
                          of persistence, I quantify the relative importance of each channel in accounting
                           for the expectations formation process of these agents. The results indicate that,
                            even for professional forecasters, there are multiple forces that generate 
                            economically significant deviations from full information.

                        Using novel survey questions on the higher-order expectations of firm managers, we study the formation and evolution of these
                        beliefs. A unique experimental approach allows us to characterize the degree of higher-order thinking
                        of economic agents and how this degree of higher-order thinking affects managers’ expectations as
                        well as their economic decisions. We then relate these results to macroeconomic models in which higher-order
                        thinking matters for dynamics.

                        This paper develops a method for measuring the information flow of economic agents at a given point in time using survey
                        data. I document a reduction in attention to the inflation process over time while simultaneously
                        finding an increase in attention to unemployment, consistent with a reallocation of their attention
                        over time. I further document that in periods in which agents are paying more attention to a specific
                        variable, there is also greater cross-sectional dispersion in attention across agents. I present
                        a potential explanation for these stylized facts based on reduced forecaster confidence in the Phillips
                        Curve relation over time.
